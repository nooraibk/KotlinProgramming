This example highlights how we can use a logger class via delegation patter and avoid using base pattern. Even though we are sometimes required to use base activity however the problem with this approach is that base activity can contain some functions which we not only are not required in all activities but also it is anti-pattern as it goes against single responsibility priciple as it wraps a lots of irrelevant functions. We could also go with the approach of making multiple base activities, but hence kotlin only allows to inherit one class, we cannot use this approach.
